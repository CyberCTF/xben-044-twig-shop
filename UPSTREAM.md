The vendored folder is that commit's benchmark folder, unchanged (canary strings included), without its Git history.

The flag is fixed: upstream's Makefile builds every benchmark with `FLAG{<sha256 of the benchmark name>}` (here, of
`XBEN-044-24`) and passes it as the build argument `FLAG`. The spec passes no build arguments, so
[`build/web/Dockerfile`](build/web/Dockerfile), the benchmark's own Dockerfile with its sources copied from
`app/`, gives `FLAG` that value as its default. Its header lists every difference from upstream's.

To update, replace the vendored folder with a newer validation-benchmarks commit, then change this file.
